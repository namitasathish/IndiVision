# IndiVision

## Overview
I wanted to create a model capable of accurately capturing and identifying the diverse range of foods from India, this project does the same and can classify images of over 200 Indian dishes using ML techniques. The model employs transfer learning with MobileNet V2 for feature extraction and classification.

## Dataset
The dataset is my own, meticulously crafted by handpicking a diverse collection of images representing a wide array of Indian dishes, including iconic dishes like biryani, dosa, samosa, and many others.

## Future Scope
**Enhanced Identification**: Increasinng the dataset images for better recognition
**Deployment**: Consider deploying the model as a user-friendly application, potentially via web or mobile platforms, to foster broader accessibility and usability.
